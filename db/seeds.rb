How cheerfully he seems to grin, how neatly spread his claws, and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws!","Alice", "Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!","Mouse", "Of course you know what 'it' means.","Mouse", "Speak English! I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!","Eaglet","The best way to explain it is to do it.","Dodo", "We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble","Dodo", "The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!","White Rabbit","How queer it seems to be going messages for a rabbit!","Alice", "I know something interesting is sure to happen whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll just see what this bottle does.","Alice","I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!","Alice", "It was much pleasanter at home, when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.","Alice", "it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life","Alice", "When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!","Alice", "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!","White Rabbit", "Do as I tell you, you coward!","White Rabbit","We must burn the house down!","White Rabbit","The first thing I've got to do is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.","Alice", "I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.","Alice", "I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir, because I'm not myself, you see.","Alice", "Keep your temper,","Caterpillar","Three inches is such a wretched height to be.","Alice","You'll get used to it in time,","Caterpillar","One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.","Caterpillar","Those serpents! There's no pleasing them!","Pigeon","As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs.","Pigeon","A likely story indeed!","Pigeon","How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another!","Alice","It's really dreadful the way all the creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!","Alice","Please would you tell me why your cat grins like that?","Alice","I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin.","Alice", "If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.","Duchess", "Chop off her head!","Duchess", "If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear, I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!","Alice", "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to","Cheshire Cat","It doesn't matter which way you go","Cheshire Cat","In that direction lives a Hatter, and in that direction lives a March Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad.","Cheshire Cat","We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad. You must be, or you wouldn't have come here.","Cheshire Cat","You see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now, I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore, I'm mad.","Cheshire Cat", "I've seen hatters before. The March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March","Alice", "I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.","Alice","Did you say pig, or fig?","Cheshire Cat","I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!","Alice", "It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,","March Hare","Why is a raven like a writing desk?","Hatter","I think you might do something better with the time than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.","Alice", "If you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn't talk about wasting it.","Hatter", "I dare say you never even spoke to Time!","Hatter", "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you're at! Up above the world you fly, like a tea-tray in the sky.","Hatter", "It's always tea-time.","Hatter", "it's very easy to take more than nothing.","Hatter","If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.","Doormouse","Did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?","Doormouse","At any rate I'll never go there again! It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!","Alice","That's very curious! But everything's curious today.","Alice","Off with her head!","Queen","Off with his head!","Queen","Off with their heads!","Queen","Are their heads off?","Queen","They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!","Alice","I'll fetch the executioner myself.","King","Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered and vinegar that makes them sour—and chamomile that makes them bitter, and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.","Alice","You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.","Duchess","Tut, tut, child! Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.","Duchess","Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.","Duchess","I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.","Duchess","Flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—'Birds of a feather flock together.'","Duchess","There's a large mustard mine near here.","Duchess","The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours","Duchess","Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.","Duchess","Now, I give you fair warning, either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!","Queen","Let's go on with the game,","Queen","Once, I was a real Turtle.","Mock Turtle","We called him Tortoise because he taught us,","Mock Turtle","Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.","Mock Turtle","If you don't know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.","Gryphon","That's the reason they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.","Gryphon","You may not have lived much under the sea, and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster, so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!","Mock Turtle ","Change lobsters again!","Gryphon","No wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.","Mock Turtle ","it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.","Alice","Explanations take such a dreadful time.","Gryphon","It's all about as curious as it can be.","Gryphon","The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!","White Rabbit","Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!","Queen","Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.","King","If any one of them can explain it, I'll give him sixpence. I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.","Alice","Sentence first—verdict afterwards.","Queen","Oh, I've had such a curious dream!","Alice"]

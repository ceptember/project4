Don't let me hear the name again!","Mouse", "Of course you know what 'it' means.","Mouse", "Speak English! I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!","Eaglet","The best way to explain it is to do it.","Dodo", "We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble","Dodo", "The Duchess!

Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!","White Rabbit", "Do as I tell you, you coward!","White Rabbit","We must burn the house down!","White Rabbit","The first thing I've got to do is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.","Alice", "I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.","Alice", "I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir, because I'm not myself, you see.","Alice", "Keep your temper,","Caterpillar","Three inches is such a wretched height to be.","Alice","You'll get used to it in time,","Caterpillar","One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.","Caterpillar","Those serpents! There's no pleasing them!","Pigeon","As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs.","Pigeon","A likely story indeed!","Pigeon","How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another!","Alice","It's really dreadful the way all the creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!","Alice","Please would you tell me why your cat grins like that?","Alice","I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin.","Alice", "If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.","Duchess", "Chop off her head!","Duchess", "If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear, I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!","Alice", "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to","Cheshire Cat","It doesn't matter which way you go","Cheshire Cat","In that direction lives a Hatter, and in that direction lives a March Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad.","Cheshire Cat","We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad. You must be, or you wouldn't have come here.","Cheshire Cat","You see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now, I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore, I'm mad.","Cheshire Cat", "I've seen hatters before. The March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March","Alice", "I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.","Alice","Did you say pig, or fig?","Cheshire Cat","I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!","Alice", "It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,","March Hare","Why is a raven like a writing desk?","Hatter","I think you might do something better with the time than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.","Alice", "If you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn't talk about wasting it.","Hatter", "I dare say you never even spoke to Time!","Hatter", "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!

But everything's curious today.","Alice","Off with her head!","Queen","Off with his head!","Queen","Off with their heads!","Queen","Are their heads off?","Queen","They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!","Alice","I'll fetch the executioner myself.","King","Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered and vinegar that makes them sour—and chamomile that makes them bitter, and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.","Alice","You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.","Duchess","Tut, tut, child! Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.","Duchess","Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.","Duchess","I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.","Duchess","Flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—'Birds of a feather flock together.'","Duchess","There's a large mustard mine near here.","Duchess","The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours","Duchess","Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.","Duchess","Now, I give you fair warning, either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!","Queen","Let's go on with the game,","Queen","Once, I was a real Turtle.","Mock Turtle","We called him Tortoise because he taught us,","Mock Turtle","Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.","Mock Turtle","If you don't know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.","Gryphon","That's the reason they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.","Gryphon","You may not have lived much under the sea, and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster, so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!","Mock Turtle","Change lobsters again!","Gryphon","No wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.","Mock Turtle","it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.","Alice","Explanations take such a dreadful time.","Gryphon","It's all about as curious as it can be.","Gryphon","The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!","White Rabbit","Behead that Dormouse!

I've been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.","It's a great huge game of chess that's being played—all over the world—if this is the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I wish I was one of them! I wouldn't mind being a Pawn, if only I might join—though of course I should like to be a Queen, best.","I know I should have to get through the Looking-glass again – back into the old room – and there'd be an end of all my adventures!","Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle; For Tweedledum said Tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle. Just then flew down a monstrous crow, as black as a tar-barrel; Which frightened both the heroes so, they quite forgot their quarrel.","Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall: Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again."]

He's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.", "I daresay you haven't had much practice.

RedQueenTLG = ["You may call it 'nonsense' if you like, but I've heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!","A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So you'll go very quickly through the Third Square—by railway, I should think—and you'll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, that square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee—the Fifth is mostly water—the Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty— the Seventh Square is all forest—however, one of the Knights will show you the way—and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's all feasting and fun!","Speak in French when you can't think of the English for a thing—turn out your toes as you walk—and remember who you are!"]

That's logic.","The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might: He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright— And this was odd, because it was the middle of the night.","The moon was shining sulkily, Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there After the day was done— 'It's very rude of him,' she said, 'To come and spoil the fun!'","The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry. You could not see a cloud, because No cloud was in the sky: No birds were flying over head— There were no birds to fly.","The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand; They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand: 'If this were only cleared away,' They said, 'it would be grand!'","'If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose,' the Walrus said, 'That they could get it clear?' 'I doubt it,' said the Carpenter, And shed a bitter tear.","'O Oysters, come and walk with us!' The Walrus did beseech. 'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, Along the briny beach: We cannot do with more than four, To give a hand to each.'","The eldest Oyster looked at him. But never a word he said: The eldest Oyster winked his eye, And shook his heavy head—Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed.","But four young oysters hurried up, All eager for the treat: Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, Their shoes were clean and neat— And this was odd, because, you know, They hadn't any feet.","Four other Oysters followed them, And yet another four; And thick and fast they came at last, And more, and more, and more—All hopping through the frothy waves, And scrambling to the shore.","The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low:And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.","'The time has come,' the Walrus said, 'To talk of many things: Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax— Of cabbages—and kings—And why the sea is boiling hot— And whether pigs have wings.'","'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried, 'Before we have our chat; For some of us are out of breath, And all of us are fat!' 'No hurry!' said the Carpenter. They thanked him much for that.","'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said, 'Is what we chiefly need: Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed—Now if you're ready Oysters dear, We can begin to feed.'","'But not on us!' the Oysters cried, Turning a little blue, 'After such kindness, that would be A dismal thing to do!' 'The night is fine,' the Walrus said 'Do you admire the view?","'It was so kind of you to come! And you are very nice!' The Carpenter said nothing but 'Cut us another slice: I wish you were not quite so deaf— I've had to ask you twice!'", "'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said, 'To play them such a trick, After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick!' The Carpenter said nothing but 'The butter's spread too thick!'", "'I weep for you,' the Walrus said. 'I deeply sympathize.'With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size. Holding his pocket handkerchief Before his streaming eyes.", "'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter. 'You've had a pleasant run! Shall we be trotting home again?'
